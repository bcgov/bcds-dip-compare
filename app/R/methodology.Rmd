In 2023, BC Stats distributed the BC Demographic Survey... (insert BCDS information here).

The Data Innovation Program (DIP) contains data from... (insert DIP data here).

Information placeholder.

#### Caveats placeholder
- Some DIP datasets were excluded from this analysis because they did not have studyids required for linking (i.e., not row-level datasets), or were considered subsets of other datasets already included (i.e., not a main source of information).
- Data from other DIP datasets was not manipulated in any way prior to analyzing linkage rates; therefore, some ‘known dip’ percentages may appear artificially high (e.g., if the variable includes Unknown values as valid responses).
- Variable names used in menus in this dashboard align with those used in the BC Demographic Survey and may be worded differently than those used in other DIP datasets; actual variable names used in a dataset are listed in the comparison tables within respective tabs.


BC Stats would like to acknowledge with gratitude the ancestral territories of the lək̓ʷəŋən speaking peoples, today known as the
Esquimalt and Songhees Nations, where this dashboard was produced.
